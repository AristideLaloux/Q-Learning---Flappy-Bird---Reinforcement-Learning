# Flappy Bird Reinforcement Learning Agent : 

## Q Learning Implementation

### Overview

This project demonstrates the implementation of a Q Learning algorithm to train a Reinforcement Learning (RL) Agent that significantly outperforms human players in the game of Flappy Bird. 

The project is structured into three Jupyter Notebooks, each serving a specific purpose :

### Notebooks details

1 - Human Play (flappy_bird_game_for_human.ipynb)

This notebook allows users to interact with the game manually. It serves as a baseline for comparing human performance with the one of the Q Learning Agent.

2 - Agent Play (flappy_bird_game_played_by_agent.ipynb)

In this notebook, the trained Q-Learning Agent plays the game. An accelerated game is coded to showcase how the trained agent outperforms human performance.

3 - Training and Testing (notebook_to_train_the_rl_agent.ipynb)

This notebook contains the core of the project.
